## When and Where Do Classes Meet?

All classes meet in person in Room E321-323 in the Robbins Building at the CWRU School of Medicine, from 1:00 to 2:15 PM.

- Each class session is **recorded** via Zoom, and the recordings are then made available for students to view using Canvas. 
- Students attending remotely (for whatever reason) can watch the Zoom as it happens (through [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/)), but will not be able to interact with the class during the session.
- Students are expected to attend **at least 20** of the 26 classes during the semester in person.

## Details

- The link for each class is to the README (starting point), which contains key announcements, slides and other links for that session.
- Readings are identified by:
  - **AOS** = David Spiegelhalter's *The Art of Statistics*
  - **R4DS** = Hadley Wickham, Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel and Garrett Grolemund, [R for Data Science, 2nd edition](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/)
    - Note that solutions for the exercises in R4DS 2e [are available here](https://mine-cetinkaya-rundel.github.io/r4ds-solutions/).
