For Project A, Professor Love has provided a lot of information but also much less flexibility than you’ll have in Project B. In particular, you’ll each be working with part of the same data set (the County Health Rankings 2023 data.) The three key analytic tasks you’ll complete are:\n\nVisualizing and modeling the relationship between a quantitative outcome and a quantitative predictor.\nVisualizing and modeling the relationship between a quantitative outcome and a categorical predictor (with 2-5 levels).\nVisualizing and modeling the relationship between a quantitative outcome and a quantitative predictor, after adjustment for the state in which the county is located\n\nYou can work alone, or with one other person on Project A. If you work as a pair, you create one project together, and each of you receive the same grade.\nThere are two sets of deliverables for Project A, and the deadlines for each are in the Course Calendar:\n\nA Project A Proposal (due at the start of October) which requires you to answer a few specific questions after creating a clean data set (a “tibble” containing specific “counties” and variables you will choose from available options.) You can (and will need to) do this work in September.\nA Project A Portfolio (due at the end of October). You’ll build Quarto and HTML files in October, after your Proposal has been accepted. As part of your Portfolio, you’ll also provide some other pieces, which are described in the Project A instructions."

Professor Love will highlight any major changes in class.\n\n\n\nYour first few steps in this course are to:\n\nRegister and enroll via the CWRU Student Information System (SIS). Note that Section 100 of PQHS 431, CRSP 431 and MPHP 431 are identical.\nReview this main course website, being sure to visit the Course Calendar.\nSkim through the Course Syllabus.\nObtain a copy of David Spiegelhalter’s The Art of Statistics: How to Learn from Data, originally published in 2020 and available at all major book retailers for around $20.\nComplete the Welcome to 431 survey, as described below.\nGet started installing the software you’ll need for the course.\nSign up for the (free) Campuswire discussion forum.\n\n\n\nPlease fill out the Welcome to 431 Survey to help us get to know you a little better.\n\nYou must log into Google via your CWRU account to access the survey.\nThe survey should take 15-20 minutes to complete, and we encourage you to do so now.\nThanks to those of you who’ve already completed the survey.\n\n\n\n\n\nClass will be held on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 1:00 - 2:15 PM in Room E321-E323 at CWRU’s School of Medicine, starting on 2023-08-29.\n\nThe Course Calendar is now available.\nThe course will be held in person, rather than online, but we will make recordings available whenever possible for those who need to miss a session. Do not come to class if you are sick.\n\n\n\n\nLearning R can be difficult at first - it’s like learning any new language. Hadley Wickham, the chief scientist at Posit (makers of RStudio) and the author of some amazing R packages you’ll be using like ggplot2 made this wise observation:\n\nIt’s easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and think, “Oh it’s me, I’m really stupid,” or, “I’m not made out to program.” But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It’s just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Don’t blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later.\n\nIf you’re finding yourself struggling or not understanding, take a break, talk to classmates, ask us for help, etc. If you’ve spent 15 minutes working on something and are stuck, don’t keep working on it, and instead ASK FOR HELP. I promise you can do this. (Thanks, Andrew Heiss)\n\n\n\nVisit the Contact Us page on this site to learn how to get help in the course.\nThank you."

    "text": "Learning R can be difficult at first - it’s like learning any new language. Hadley Wickham, the chief scientist at Posit (makers of RStudio) and the author of some amazing R packages you’ll be using like ggplot2 made this wise observation:\n\nIt’s easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and think, “Oh it’s me, I’m really stupid,” or, “I’m not made out to program.” But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It’s just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Don’t blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later.\n\nIf you’re finding yourself struggling or not understanding, take a break, talk to classmates, ask us for help, etc. If you’ve spent 15 minutes working on something and are stuck, don’t keep working on it, and instead ASK FOR HELP. I promise you can do this. (Thanks, Andrew Heiss)"

    "text": "Updating Your R Packages\nEvery once in a while, it’s a good idea to update your R packages. To do so,\n\nGo to the Packages tab on the right side of your RStudio screen, and click on Update.\nThis will bring up a dialog box. I usually click Select All, then click Install Updates.\n\n\nA popup box may appear, asking “Do you want to install from sources the packages which need compilation?” to which I usually answer No. A Yes response leads to a slower installation, but can solve problems if you still have them after updating.\nThis may take a few minutes. As long as you’re seeing activity in the Console window, things are progressing.\nEventually, you’ll get a message that “The downloaded source packages are in …” with a directory name. That’s the sign that the updating is done.\nUpdating packages is something you’ll do occasionally throughout the semester, mostly when a problem happens.\n\n\nFinally, choose File … Quit Session from the top menu, and accept or deny (I usually deny) RStudio’s request to save your workspace. Then close RStudio, and re-open it if you want to do some work."
