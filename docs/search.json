Hadley Wickham, the chief scientist at Posit (makers of RStudio) and the author of some amazing R packages you’ll be using like ggplot2 made this wise observation:\n\nIt’s easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and think, “Oh it’s me, I’m really stupid,” or, “I’m not made out to program.” But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It’s just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Don’t blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later.\n\nIf you’re finding yourself struggling or not understanding, take a break, talk to classmates, ask us for help, etc. If you’ve spent 15 minutes working on something and are stuck, don’t keep working on it, and instead ASK FOR HELP. I promise you can do this. (Thanks, Andrew Heiss)"

To do so,\n\nGo to the Packages tab on the right side of your RStudio screen, and click on Update.\nThis will bring up a dialog box. I usually click Select All, then click Install Updates.\n\n\nA popup box may appear, asking “Do you want to install from sources the packages which need compilation?” to which I usually answer No. A Yes response leads to a slower installation, but can solve problems if you still have them after updating.\nThis may take a few minutes. As long as you’re seeing activity in the Console window, things are progressing.\nEventually, you’ll get a message that “The downloaded source packages are in …” with a directory name. That’s the sign that the updating is done.\nUpdating packages is something you’ll do occasionally throughout the semester, mostly when a problem happens.\n\n\nFinally, choose File … Quit Session from the top menu, and accept or deny (I usually deny) RStudio’s request to save your workspace. Then close RStudio, and re-open it if you want to do some work."
